### Decks:
Sample Deck:
All sample jokers are free! But you start with no face cards and no aces

### Misc. Ideas:

## Split Cards:

New way to get stronger cards, with a certain tarot card [Scisors], you can split two cards in two,
with an another tarot card [Tape] you can fuse the half-cards together.

Half-cards only take 0.5 hand space

[Exemple: I split a 10 of Spades and a 8 of Hearts, the two cards get split in 4 half-cards, the half-cards of Ten give 5 chips, and the half-cards give 4.
If you use tape on the half of a 10 of Spades and a half of a 8 of Hearts, the new card will give 9 (5+4) and will count as a 10 and 8 and also as a Spade and a Heart card. ]

Enhancement may be kept but halved if I managed to code that shit.

## Sample Packs:

New type of jokers and booster packs !
Sample Jokers are less powerful version of already existing Jokers, BUT the catch is that they can appear multiple times in the shop!
They may or may not take 0.5 of a Joker Slot but I'm not sure yet.
Useful for early game.
I may add something that happens when you get a Sample Joker and its real Joker counterpart but I haven't had any idea yet.
